First of all, thanks for contibuting to DankBot, I realy apreciate it !

However, there are certain things you need to respect to contribute.

## Code style
The code needs to respect the linting file I've provided. This is to assure a constant code style.

I know it can be annoying some times, but I made the rules to not be too restrictive ;)

## What pull request I accept
* Bug fixes
* New USEFULL commands
* Refractoring for performance enhencement

## What pull request I reject
* Very specific commands (create a plugin instead)
* Stupid stuff / jokes (obviously)

In any case, thanks again for making DankBot better :)
